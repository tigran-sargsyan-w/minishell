# minishell
This project is about creating a simple shell. Yes, your own little bash. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

# Minishell - Lexer Test Cases

## 📜 Token Legend
- `WORD(...)` — normal word token
- `PIPE(|)` — pipe token `|`
- `REDIRECT_OUT(>)` — output redirection token `>`
- `REDIRECT_IN(<)` — input redirection token `<`
- Errors are also expected results in some tests.

## How to mark tests manually:
- If the test has not yet been passed, the Checked column shows ⬜ (empty cell).
- If the test is successfully passed, you replace ⬜ with ✅ (check mark).
